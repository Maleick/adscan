**Free Active Directory pentesting CLI for AD enumeration, BloodHound, Kerberoasting, ADCS, and attack paths.**

ADscan is a free Linux CLI for pentesters, red teamers, and security consultants who need one workflow for Active Directory enumeration, BloodHound collection, Kerberoasting, AS-REP roasting, ADCS checks, password spraying, DCSync, credential dumping, and evidence export.

It is built for real internal Active Directory assessments and labs, so you can go from unauthenticated recon to privilege escalation from one terminal instead of juggling isolated scripts, cheatsheets, and wrappers.

## 🚀 Quick Start

ADscan runs inside Docker and supports both **x86_64 (amd64)** and **ARM64 (aarch64)** Linux hosts.

### Prerequisites
- Docker Engine with Docker Compose plugin
- Python 3.9+ (for the launcher)

### Installation

```bash
# Install the launcher
pipx install adscan

# Pull the ADscan Docker image (includes all tools)
adscan install

# Start ADscan
adscan start
```

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone and build the Docker image
git clone https://github.com/Maleick/adscan.git
cd adscan
docker build -f Dockerfile.runtime -t adscan:local .

# Run locally built image
adscan start --image adscan:local
```

## 🎯 Why Pentesters Use ADscan

- **Active Directory enumeration from one CLI:** DNS, LDAP, SMB, Kerberos, trust, ADCS, and BloodHound-ready collection in one workflow.
- **Attack execution without tool-hopping:** Kerberoasting, AS-REP roasting, password spraying, GPP, DCSync, and credential workflows stay inside the same workspace.
- **Built for real pentest cadence:** use it in internal AD audits, red team operations, HTB/VulnLab labs, and repeatable attack-path validation.
- **Evidence-first output:** keep domain-scoped workspaces and export TXT/JSON artifacts for reports, retesting, or client handoff.

## ⚡ Common Active Directory Pentest Workflows

Use ADscan when you need to move quickly through internal Active Directory assessments:

- **CTF and lab auto-pwn:** reproduce HTB Forest, Active, and Cicada attack chains from the docs.
- **Unauthenticated AD recon:** discover domains, DNS, SMB exposure, null sessions, users, and roastable accounts.
- **Authenticated enumeration:** collect LDAP, SMB, Kerberos, ADCS, BloodHound CE data, and credential exposure.
- **Privilege escalation:** execute supported Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, DCSync, GPP password, ADCS, and local credential workflows.
- **Evidence handling:** keep workspaces isolated and export findings to TXT/JSON for reports.

## 🧭 Usage Examples

```bash
adscan start
start_unauth
```

<tr>
<td width="50%">

### LITE (Free, Source Available)

**Everything a pentester could do manually, 10x faster:**
- ✅ Three operation modes (automatic/semi-auto/manual)
- ✅ DNS, LDAP, SMB, Kerberos enumeration
- ✅ AS-REP Roasting & Kerberoasting
- ✅ Password spraying
- ✅ BloodHound collection & analysis
- ✅ Credential harvesting (SAM, LSA, DCSync)
- ✅ ADCS detection & template enumeration
- ✅ GPP passwords & CVE enumeration
- ✅ Export to TXT/JSON
- ✅ Workspace & evidence management

</td>
<td width="50%">

### PRO

**What nobody can do manually in reasonable time:**
- 🎯 Algorithmic attack graph generation
- 🎯 Auto-exploitation chains (DNS to DA)
- 🎯 ADCS ESC1-13 auto-exploitation
- 🎯 MITRE-mapped Word/PDF reports
- 🎯 Multi-domain trust spidering
- 🎯 Advanced privilege escalation chains
- 🎯 Priority enterprise support
